1. # of sets: S/(B*A)
   # of index bits in the address = log_2(S/(B*A)
   # of tag bits = k - log_2(S/(B*A)) - b

2. Consider a virtual memory system with the following properties:

40-bit virtual byte address
16 KB pages
36 bit physical byte address What is the total size of the page table for each process on this processor, assuming that the valid, protection, dirty, and use bits take a total of 4 bits and that all the virtual pages are in use? (Assume that disk addresses are not stored in the page table.)

3. Average memory access time = Hit Time + Miss Rate * Miss Penalty
   AMAT = 1 + 0.2*(4+0.1*(0.05*100+20)) = 2.3
